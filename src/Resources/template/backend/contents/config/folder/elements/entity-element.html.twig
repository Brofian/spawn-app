TODO: Entity select
<br>
--> probably load via ajax? Because we have to check if the entity is valid and load the available entities
<br>
--> maybe only load the selected entity and the rest only upon opening the selection
<br>
Remember to allow the user to select multiple entities, if set
<br>
Idea: store the selected entities by the identifier, separated by pipes
